## Have a dedicated “Income” section in your application
<img align="right" style="max-width: 50%; border: 1px solid; margin: 10px;" src="../images/dedicatedIncome.png">
Collect income information in one dedicated section. If an application asks all income questions at the same time, the applicant can focus on: 
* Gathering any needed information or documents (like paystubs).
* Entering all income information during one session.

This helps clients avoid context-switching and encourages them to complete the income section.
