## Have a dedicated “Income” section in your application
<img align="right" style="max-width: 50%" src="https://github.com/navapbc/FFS-IncomeReportingToolkit/assets/776667/68f3aaf7-38c3-49c1-930a-28e019c16d12">
Collect income information in one dedicated section. If an application asks all income questions at the same time, the applicant can focus on: 
* Gathering any needed information or documents (like paystubs).
* Entering all income information during one session.

This helps clients avoid context-switching and encourages them to complete the income section.
